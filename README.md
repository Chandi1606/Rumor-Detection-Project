## Multi-Modal Meta Multi-Task Learning for Social Media Rumor Detection

This is a final-year MCA project that presents a Java-based implementation of Multi-Modal Meta Multi-Task Learning for detecting rumors on social media platforms. The model integrates multiple types of features (text, metadata, media, etc.) using a meta-learning approach and performs multiple tasks (e.g., rumor detection, stance classification) simultaneously to improve performance and generalization.

## ðŸ§  Project Abstract
With the exponential rise of misinformation on social media, automatic rumor detection has become a critical need. This project focuses on leveraging multi-modal data (text, images, user metadata) and performing multi-task learning using meta-learning principles to enhance the accuracy and robustness of rumor detection models. Implemented in Java, the system handles data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction.

## âœ¨ Features
âœ… Supports multi-modal input: text, metadata, and images (if applicable)

âœ… Implements multi-task learning: rumor detection and auxiliary tasks (e.g., stance detection)

âœ… Uses meta-learning to adapt quickly to new tasks or domains

âœ… Built-in data preprocessing and cleaning modules

âœ… Custom Java-based ML pipeline

âœ… Lightweight UI for testing inputs (optional)
