MCA final year project_Multi-Modal Meta Multi-Task Learning for Social Media Rumor Detection

Abstract:
With the rapid development of social media platforms and the increasing scale of the social media data, the rumor detection task has become vitally important since the authenticity of posts cannot be guaranteed. To date, many approaches have been proposed to facilitate the rumor detection process by utilizing the multi-task learning mechanism, which aims to improve the performance of rumor detection task by leveraging the useful information contained instance detection task. Therefore, designed a Multi-Modal Meta Multi-Task Learning (MM-MTL) framework for social media rumor detection task. 

Conclusion:
In Multi-Modal Meta Multi-Task Learning for Social Media Rumor Detection,  design a novel Multi-Modal Meta Multi-Task Learning (MM-MTL) framework to detect social media rumors. Specifically, the aim to improve the performance of rumor detection task by leveraging the stance information of users’ replies in stance detection. In the future, more rumor related tasks will introduce into the multi-modal meta multi-task learning framework, such as user’s trustworthiness evaluation task.
